## This Augmented Reality game application, Slimeageddon: Street Hunter, was developed on Unity 6. This is my take on a project where we were required to create a slingshot-type game that uses horizontal plane detection, spawns moving targets, and allows the player to launch projectiles at them in a real-world space. With this project, I had to learn many new concepts to complete it, like AR fundamentals, AR game mechanics, and creating functional and interactive UI for mobile devices. With 4 weeks to complete this project from start to finish, I am extremely proud of the product I was able to deliver. While featuring the mentioned requirements, I added an interactive main menu, a how-to-play screen, fun audio at key moments, a weapon source for the projectiles, and a few other extra things to add some character to my game. Below are the assets I used to create this project and all the others I made myself. If you are interested in trying the game yourself there is a download for Android and iOS below as well. Thank you for viewing!

<summary><h3>The plot of the game:</h3></summary>
<ul>The world has been overrun by slimes - seemingly cute blobs with little hats. Once harmless and fun, the slimes have grown in number and some have become more aggressive.
You play as a hunter tasked with removing the slime threat. You are equipped with a crossbow and arrows to take on the slimes from afar. Using your device's camera, the slime creatures will appear in real-world surroundings. 
There are three types of slimes you‚Äôll encounter in the wild: The common slimes, these cute little goofballs look harmless but they always travel in packs! The warrior slimes, these guys are smart and have tough armor, don‚Äôt let them sneak up on you! The King slimes rule them all, they command hordes of warrior slimes as minions. Taking down these little bosses will save the city! 
Travel the streets, parks, and neighborhoods to find and battle slimes. Can you defeat the slimes and rid the world of this infestation? Good luck, hunter - the slimes are waiting!
