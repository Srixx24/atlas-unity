This repository contains many projects from my third trimester of AR/VR development specialization, with a few sprinkled in from my fourth trimester as well. During this time a greater understanding of Unity and how it functions formed; some projects I'm really proud of are located here. See below for some examples.

1. With this project <a href="https://github.com/Srixx24/atlas-unity/tree/main/unity-animation">unity-animation</a> I learned much about animation in unity. How to make transition scenes, animate a player in a 3d game, give life to objects, and so much more. It was so much fun learning these skills.
